Explanation:
Anchors (^ and $):

^ asserts the position at the start of the string.
$ asserts the position at the end of the string.
These ensure that the entire string must match the pattern, not just a part of it.
Day Part (0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01]):

0[1-9] matches days from 01 to 09:
0 is a literal zero.
[1-9] matches any digit from 1 to 9.
[12][0-9] matches days from 10 to 29:
[12] matches either 1 or 2.
[0-9] matches any digit from 0 to 9.
3[01] matches days 30 and 31:
3 is a literal three.
[01] matches either 0 or 1.
The entire group is enclosed in parentheses and separated by | (OR operator), allowing for any valid day from 01 to 31.
Hyphen (-):

- is a literal hyphen used to separate the day, month, and year parts in the date format.
Month Part (Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec):

Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec matches any of the abbreviated month names.
Each month abbreviation is separated by | (OR operator), ensuring any valid three-letter month abbreviation is matched.
Hyphen (-):

Another literal hyphen used to separate the month and year parts.
Year Part \d{2}:

\d matches any digit (equivalent to [0-9]).
{2} specifies exactly two occurrences of the preceding element (a digit).
This ensures the year part consists of exactly two digits.
Summary:
The regex ensures that the date string starts and ends with the specified pattern.
The day part is matched against valid days (01 to 31).
The month part is matched against valid abbreviated month names (Jan, Feb, etc.).
The year part is matched against any two-digit year (00 to 99).
This regex pattern ensures that only properly formatted DD-mmm-yy dates are considered valid.
