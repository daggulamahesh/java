To add a secret to HashiCorp Vault using the CLI in PuTTY, follow these steps:


---

Prerequisites

1. Vault CLI Installed: Ensure the vault CLI is installed on the server you are accessing through PuTTY.


2. Vault Server Running: Verify that the Vault server is up and running.


3. Authenticated: Log into Vault using your token or other authentication methods.

Steps to Add a Secret

1. Set the Vault Address: If you are running Vault locally:

export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

For remote servers, replace 127.0.0.1 with the server's IP or hostname.


2. Authenticate with Vault: Use your token to log in:

vault login <YOUR_TOKEN>

Replace <YOUR_TOKEN> with the actual Vault token.


3. Enable Key/Value Secret Engine (if not already enabled): Run this command to enable the KV secret engine:

vault secrets enable -path=secret kv

By default, it enables KV version 2.


4. Add a Secret: Use the following command to add a key-value pair:

vault kv put secret/<PATH> <KEY>=<VALUE>

Example:

vault kv put secret/myapp username=admin password=1234


5. Verify the Secret: Retrieve the secret to verify:

vault kv get secret/<PATH>

Example:

vault kv get secret/myapp


6. List Secrets (Optional): To list secrets stored in a specific path:

vault kv list secret/

Notes

Replace secret/ with the appropriate path if a custom mount path is used for the KV engine.

Ensure you have the necessary policies/permissions to add secrets in Vault. Policies control which paths and operations a user or token can access.
